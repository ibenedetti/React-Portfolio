        <h3>How I Came To This</h3>
        <p>
          After deciding to retire from live shows for the time being, and having just arrived to a new country with no friends or family, I went on to take the closest job I could get to what I knew. So I became an industrial measurement equipment technician. <br />
          It was challenging starting in a new field so suddenly, but my electronics knowledge translated nicely into this new job, and I learned so much I felt like I was born for this, but I felt something missing. That was until I saw one of my seniors writing code for a PCB in Pascal, and I knew I wanted to learn how to code.
