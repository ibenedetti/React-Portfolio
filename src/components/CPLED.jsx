        <h3>My Biggest Mistake</h3>
        <p>
          When I started meeting people from courses and doing some networking, I started getting called to refactor and fix the Javascript code for a bunch of students and people with the weirdest websites I've seen.<br/>
          That's how i got stuck in an infinite loop of constantly coding without being able to show my work, because that'd mean that someone could lose their job for outsourcing to me, but I lived in the third world and the money was not bad, so I keep doing it.
        </p>

    </div>
